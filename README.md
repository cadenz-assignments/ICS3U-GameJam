# ICS3U - GameJam
This is the ICS3U Introduction to Computer Science course game jam project. 

## Features
- This game surrounds the idea of procedural generation. Similar to Minecraft, this game has a infinitely procedurally generated world.  
- All the generated world are stored in smaller chunks, and they are stored as json files. Only a 3x3 area of the world around the player will be loaded. The rest are stored in json format and accessed and loaded when needed.

## Vision
My vision for this game is a factory building game on an unknown planet, with Multiplayer aspects such as Co-op and competitive game modes. But due to time limitations during the game jam, I was not able to complete everything I have envisioned for the game. This is merely a prototype of what I have in mind for this game. I might continue working on this project in the future.

## Tech Stack
- Unity Game Engine
- .NET Framework
